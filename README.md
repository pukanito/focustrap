Packages for implementing a focus trap in JavaScript.

## Recreate the basic workspace:

- create a new workspace for the focustrap: `npx create-nx-workspace focustrap --preset=ts`
- add `nx` script to main `package.json`: `"nx": "nx"`
- create the `focusable` library: `npm run nx -- g @nx/js:lib focusable`
- create the `test-focusable` application: `npm run nx g @nx/angular:application test-focusable`

- build: `npm run nx -- build focusable` (from the root project directory)
- test: `npm run nx -- test focusable` (from the root project directory)
- publishing:

### Testing

The `test-focusable` application is used for testing the build `focusable` library. 
Run: `npm run nx -- serve test-focusable` to build and start the application. If
everything goes well there will be some green in the browser.
