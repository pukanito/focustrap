Packages for implementing a focus trap in JavaScript.

- build all: `npm run nx -- run-many -t build` (from the root project directory)
- test all: `npm run nx -- run-many -t test` (from the root project directory)

## Focusable

Finds keyboard-focusable elements within a specified element’s subtree.

- build: `npm run nx -- build focusable` (from the root project directory)
- test: `npm run nx -- test focusable` (from the root project directory)
- publishing:

### Testing

The `test-focusable` application is used for testing the build `focusable` library. 
Run: `npm run nx -- serve test-focusable` to build and start the application. If
everything goes well there will be some green in the browser.

## FocusTrap

Trap keyboard focus inside an element when navigating with the keyboard.

- build: `npm run nx -- build focustrap` (from the root project directory)
- test: `npm run nx -- test focustrap` (from the root project directory)
- publishing:

### Testing

The `test-focustrap` application is used for testing the build `focustrap` library.
Run: `npm run nx -- serve test-focustrap` to build and start the application. You can 
switch the focus trap on and off and tab around.

## Notes

### Recreate the basic workspace:

- create a new workspace for the focustrap: `npx create-nx-workspace focustrap --preset=ts`
- add `nx` script to main `package.json`: `"nx": "nx"`
- create the `focusable` library: `npm run nx -- g @nx/js:lib focusable`
- create the `test-focusable` application: `npm run nx -- g @nx/angular:application test-focusable`
- create the `focusable` library: `npm run nx -- g @nx/js:lib focustrap`
- create the `test-focustrap` application: `npm run nx -- g @nx/angular:application test-focustrap`

### npm login from wsl windows 11

- Use: `npm login --auth-type=legacy`

### Focustrap, NX default changes

#### jest.config.ts

- added `modulePaths` and `moduleNameMapper` to find the focusable library.
  `prefix` is set to `<rootDir>/../` because the `dist` directory in the mappings
  is one level higher than the root of the `focustrap` library.

```typescript
/* eslint-disable */
const { pathsToModuleNameMapper } = require('ts-jest');
const { compilerOptions } = require('../tsconfig.base.json');

export default {
  // default config
  modulePaths: [compilerOptions.baseUrl],
  moduleNameMapper: pathsToModuleNameMapper(compilerOptions.paths, {
    prefix: '<rootDir>/../',
  }),
};
```

#### tsconfig.spec.json

- added `jest-setup.ts` to the `include`'s so that `@testing-library/jest-dom`
  matchers are recognized by Intellij.

```json
{
  "...": "default settings",
  "include": [
    "...",
    "jest-setup.ts"
  ]
}

```
